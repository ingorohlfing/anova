## ANOVA for comparison of means

The Shiny app (for now in German) illustrates how an ANOVA can be used to compare 
means across multiple groups. Depending on the input for six observations, two 
each per three groups, the app calculates the F-statistic, the total variance and
sum of squares; the between-group variance and sum of squares; and the within-group
variance and sum of squares.

The app is hosted on a [Shiny server](https://ingorohlfing.shinyapps.io/anova_for_means/).
